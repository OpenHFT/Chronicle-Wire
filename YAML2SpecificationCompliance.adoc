== YAML 1.2 Specification Compliance

Chronicle Wire supports most of the features available from the YAML 2 specification.
TEXT wire type supports a narrow subset which is sufficient to encode and parse Wire record graphs, whereas
YAML wire type aims to parse most real-life Yaml documents.
This section lists those features and suggests workarounds in Chronicle Wire may define the same
thing.
