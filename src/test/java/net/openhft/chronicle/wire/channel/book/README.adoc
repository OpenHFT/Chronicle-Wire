= Top Of Book Sample
Peter Lawrey

HFT code can be difficult to develop and test.
Chronicle Wires a high level layer to ease Behaviour Driven Development and maintainability while still supporting high performance.

In this sample, an event with a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is sent over TCP to trivial microservice and echoed back.
Over 2 billion events per second were sent/receives,m across 16 clients connections on a single Ryzen 5950X.

== High Level Interface

While some HFT libaries use flyweights wrapping off heap memory, these can be hard to test, debug and maintain.
Chronicle Wire attempts to provide very efficient (de)serialization directly to/from off heap memory, in a high level interface that is easy to contract Behviour Driven tests for.

NOTE: All the data is encoded as primitives to minimise overhead.
More complex structures like String, List, Map, Set, and arrays are supported but are slower.

The source for the benchmark is available here link:PerfTopOfBookMain.java[]

== High performance features

Data is buffered and written by a background thread.
This increases throughput by about a factor for ten for messages of this size due to the relatively high cost of writing a message at a time.

Data in the POJO is copied to the direct ByteBuffer and copied back again without any additional copies or processing.

The proxies used for method call representing the event encoded as a message and decoding the message and making the same method call use generated code to make them light weight.

The proxy for decoding recycles the POJO it passes to the microservice.
The microservice has to expect the data in it needs to be copied if it is to be retained between events.
This ensures that even though 2 billion events are processed in a minute, only 2 objects are created.
(One the client and one on the server)

== Java version

In the past, there wasn't a clear advantage in using a newer version of Java, however in this case, it made a difference.

|===
| Java Version | Throughput

| Oracle JDK 1.8.0_321 & Azul Zulu 1.8.0_322
| 3.6 billion/min

| Azul Zulu 11.0.11
| 4.0 billion/min

| Azul Zulu 17.0.4.1
| 4.1 billion/min

| Azul Zulu 18.0.2.1 & Oracle JDK 18.0.2.1
| 4.0 billion/min
